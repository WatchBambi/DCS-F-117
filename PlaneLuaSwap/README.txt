To swap to the funny loadouts, just backup your original F-117.lua in the base folder and replace it
with the new one here. You must rename the new one to F-117.lua.


A note about the HARMs: Only fire one at a time. 

You can fire both, but the second HARM will 
always follow the first one UNTIL the first one hits its target, then it will abruptly
switch to the target you designated for the second HARM. This is okay if the targets
are really close together, just give 5-10 seconds separation between the two missiles.
